What is rankR: 

	-A fullstack social media site that allows users to rank anything from their favorite shows, songs, or sports teams, developed using a MERN.js stack.
	
	
Main Features: 

	-Users can perform all four CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). 

	-Authentication Process: users need to log in (or create an account) before making a post. 

	-Search Bar that filters through all lists. 

	-Users share the ability to either like or dislike a post.
	
	
Why: 

	-My friends and I love to share our opinions on our favorite shows, sports players, or activities all the time. And this is typically done in the form of a list. Oftentimes, my friends keep a note of their "Top 10 TV shows" or "Top 10 Football Players" to send in our group chat to start a conversation. Sharing our opinion on our favorite things and starting conversations is fun. People like talking about media/sports/songs they like. This social media is made for this exact purpose.
	
	
Outcomes: 

	-After developing my personal portfolio and learning react.js, I was excited to further my web building skills by developing a full stack application. I was determined to learn, and I can say that through the many new challenges and bugs I faced in developing this project, I have become a significantly more experienced developer than before. This was the biggest project I have taken on so far and it has significantly expanded my knowledge as a developer.


How to Use: 

	-To start using RankR, you can click "Sign In" on the Navigation Bar and proceed to "Sign Up" to create an account. 

	-Once you are signed in, you will have the ability to create a list. When creating a list, use a comma to separate items in your list in the "Content" section. Eg. an input of "Tacos,Burritos" in the content block will display as a list of two items: 1)Tacos 2)Burritos 

	-When you are logged in, you will also be able to like or dislike any other user's post. 

	-You will also be able to edit and delete posts that you yourself have made. To edit, click the pencil shaped button on the top right of your list. To delete, click the trash shaped logo on the bottom right of your list.


Future: 

	-In the near future, I plan to revamp some attributes of the site to sustain thousands of users. This would include the ability to "friend" other users and have more privacy options.
